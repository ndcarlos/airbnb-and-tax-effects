    "Why do these curves look different than the normal linear supply and demand curves in the textbook? It's because in the textbook we've made a vastly simplifying assumptions that supply and demand curves are linear in nature. This would imply that, no matter at what price, a price decrease by \\\\$1 would change the amount supplied or demanded by the same amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this intuitively true? Probably not. For example, a \\\\$1 decrease from \\\\$100 is trivial compared to a \\\\$1 decrease from an original price of \\\\$2. As humans, we think about changes as proportions, and this fact should be reflected in the supply and demand curves. What this implies is that these curves should be exponential in nature: at higher prices, a larger change in price will yield the same change quantity as compared to that in lower prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your curves above should look somewhat exponential, which aligns with this intuition!\n",

    "Another caveat: our results show a kind of 'local' effect and may not necessarily be generalizable to all Airbnb units everywhere. Recall that from our filters in part 1, our market only describes goods that are Airbnb stays in entire homes/apartments that occurred on the weekend over during the early summer months of 2019 (pre-July).

    "As a popular alternative to hotels, Airbnb has become subject to occupancy taxes in cities around the world. These taxes are applied to short term lodgings and are typically enforced by local or state governments in the United States. Proponents of the tax argue that existing rules that apply to hotels should also be enforced for Airbnb. Opponents instead argue that these laws do not apply to services created out of excess capacity, and the tax would stifle innovation and growth in the industry<sup>2</sup>.\n",

The effectiveness of the tax depends on what goals the government has. If they simply want less people renting short-term rentals it is certainly effective. I am curious as to whether or not people began booking hotels more with the decline in Airbnb rentals, or if the city as a whole saw a decrease in visitors because of the tax."

The tax may have had no effect on the demand by them.\n",
